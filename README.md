# spellinator

Have you ever wondered how words _could have_ been spelled using different letter combinations for the same sounds? Well wonder no longer! With the Spellinator,
you can find out! 

The program takes a phoneme (sound units) to graphemes (writing units) map to phonetically map a word into possible _pronunciations_, then reverse map those pronunciations into
possible spellings. An optional second phoneme map allows transliteration into a different alphabet, and a grapheme weights file rejects unlikely output combinations (ex: `rrr`
or `thh` that result from phonetic mappings).
